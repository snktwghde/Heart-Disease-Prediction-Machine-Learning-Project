# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning App

This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning application** that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes.  
The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Built and evaluated multiple ML models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Achieved **>85% accuracy** across all models
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment
- Deployed using **Streamlit**

## 🧠 Features Used for Prediction

The model uses the following 13 medical features:

1. Age  
2. Sex  
3. Chest Pain Type  
4. Resting Blood Pressure  
5. Cholesterol  
6. Fasting Blood Sugar  
7. Resting ECG  
8. Maximum Heart Rate  
9. Exercise Induced Angina  
10. Oldpeak (ST Depression)  
11. Slope of ST Segment  
12. Number of Major Vessels  
13. Thalassemia
